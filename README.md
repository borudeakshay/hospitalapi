# hospitalapi

Weâ€™re going to design an API for the doctors of a Hospital 

There can be 2 types of Users

Doctors

Patients

Doctors can log in

Each time a patient visits, the doctor will follow 2 steps

Register the patient in the app (using phone number, if the patient already exists, just return the patient info in the API)
